# Music Classification: Beyond Supervised Learning, Towards Real-world Applications
## About the book

This is a book written for a [tutorial session](https://ismir2021.ismir.net/tutorials/) of [the 22nd International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference](https://ismir2021.ismir.net/), Nov 8-12, 2021 in an online format. The [ISMIR conference](https://ismir.net/) is the worldâ€™s leading research forum on processing, searching, organising and accessing music-related data.

[**Minz Won**](https://minzwon.github.io/) is a Ph.D candidate at the 
[Music Technology Group (MTG) of Universitat Pompeu Fabra](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg) in Barcelona, Spain. 
His research focus is music representation learning. 
Along with his academic career, he has put his knowledge into practice with industry internships at 
Kakao Corp., Naver Corp., Pandora, Adobe, and he recently joined ByteDance as a research scientist. 
He contributed to the winning entry in the WWW 2018 Challenge: Learning to Recognize Musical Genre.

[**Janne Spijkervet**](https://jspijkervet.com/) graduated from the University of Amsterdam in 2021 with her 
Master's thesis titled "Contrastive Learning of Musical Representations". The paper with the same title was published 
in 2020 on self-supervised learning on raw audio in music tagging. She has started at ByteDance as 
a research scientist (2020 - present), developing generative models for music creation. 
She is also a songwriter and music producer, and explores the design and use of machine learning technology in her music.

[**Keunwoo Choi**](https://keunwoochoi.github.io/) is a senior research scientist at ByteDance, developing machine learning 
products for music recommendation and discovery. He received a Ph.D degree from 
[Queen Mary University of London (c4dm)](https://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/) in 2018. As a researcher, he also has been 
working at Spotify (2018 - 2020) and several other music companies as well as open-source projects such as 
[`Kapre`](https://kapre.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), `librosa`, and `torchaudio`. 
He also writes [some music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6WGQvwwM3M7sX98zJ14XPA).

## Motivation
As deep learning emerges, music classification research has entered a new phase, and many data-driven approaches have been proposed to solve the problem. However, sometimes researchers discuss the same topic in different languages or compare different concepts as if they are the same. Also, some implementation details and evaluation methods are ambiguously described in the papers; hence the details can be only obtained by personally contacting the authors. These make tremendous obstacles when new researchers want to dive into the fascinating research area. Through this book, we would like to lower the barrier for newcomers, and also, we would like to reduce miscommunication between researchers by disambiguating hidden secrets that have been passed down hand-to-hand.

Another issue that we are facing under deep learning hype is the lack of labeled data. Labeling musical attributes typically require strong domain knowledge and a significant amount of time for listening; hence expensive. Deep learning researchers started actively utilizing large-scale unlabeled data to tackle classification problems. This book introduces recent advances in semi- and self-supervised learning so that music classification models can step further beyond supervised learning.

Music classification has been explored to be applied to solve real-world problems. However, we often witness that some important procedures and considerations for real-world applications are overlooked and rarely discussed as research topics. In this book, we try our best to raise the awareness of these questions and provide answers, or our perspectives, based on the various industry experiences of the authors. We hope this reduces the gap between academia and industries so that both important pillars to be harmonized together.
