# What We Do in Industry

By Keunwoo Choi

Academia and industry have different goals and focuses. Sometimes, it's useful to learn what's happening on the other
side. In this section, we'll cover what's common in industry but not in academia.   


# About the Problems 

Let's imagine we initialize a world with these conditions and train it for a long while.  
 
|     \     | [A] Has more freedom in | [B] Has Bias towards   |
| --------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Academia  | Choosing the topics | Publishable topics |
| Industry  |  Using resources (time, budget, work force) | Profitable topics  |

As a result, we'll see each entity uses [A] to specialize in [B]. 
And that's great! But, for the same reason, some topics are getting little attention in academia.

What reasons exactly?

## What makes a topic difficult to work on in Academia?

- When it feels like it's solved --> You can't write a paper about it anymore!
- When it's hard to create a dataset --> In this data-driven era, it's a deal breaker.
- When the problem is too new / there's no dataset for it --> No way, of course.
- When it's difficult to evaluate --> Don't feed Reviewer 2 a reason for rejection!
