# Semi-supervised learning


Semi-supervised learning is a machine learning approach that utilizes both small-sized labeled data and large-scale unlabeled data. It is a very common scenario in real-world data. The Million Song Dataset (MSD) for example, although it includes 1 million tracks, only 24% of them are labeled with at least one of the top-50 music tags. As a result, most previous works in MSD tagging discarded 76% of the MSD tracks. In this section, we explore semi-supervised approaches to take advantage of the unlabeled data to improve music classification performance.
